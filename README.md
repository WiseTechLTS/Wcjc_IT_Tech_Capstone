## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced ticket escalation system for a modern healthcare clinic and its third-party IT escalation team. Our goal is to create a seamless platform that enables efficient issue tracking, resolution workflows, and communication between clinic staff, internal IT, and external IT support teams.

By building a system that closely mirrors real-world IT support structures, we will enhance prioritization, escalation, and resolution processes within high-demand medical environments. This solution will improve response times, minimize downtime, and facilitate better collaboration among technical teams.

## Problem Statement

Efficient IT support is critical in a healthcare environment where operational continuity directly impacts patient care. The current system for handling technical issues is fragmented, leading to delays in issue resolution and a lack of visibility for stakeholders.

- Delayed response times: Clinic staff often wait too long for IT support, affecting workflow efficiency.
- Unstructured escalation processes: Internal IT lacks a formalized process to determine when and how to escalate complex issues to third-party specialists.
- Lack of real-time tracking: There is no centralized system where all stakeholders can monitor ticket progress and resolution history.
- Communication gaps: Misalignment between clinic staff, internal IT, and external IT support leads to redundant troubleshooting and missed priorities.

The proposed system will address these issues by providing an automated and transparent ticket tracking and escalation platform that ensures swift resolution, priority handling, and seamless collaboration.
